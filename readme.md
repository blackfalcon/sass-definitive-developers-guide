# Sass: The Definitive Developer's Guide

Do you use Sass? Sure you do, or you wouldn't be reading this. Sass pioneered the CSS pre-processing, and now the post processing, era. Single handed, it changed the landscape of front-end development forever. But like many, you may feel frustrated as to it's conventions, uses and best practices.

I myself have been frustrated by this and personally set out years ago to fill the gap of knowledge. Many others have followed in this pursuit of understanding as well. Many of whom I will reference in this Definitive Developer's Guide.

The promise of this book is to be open source. Free to distribute and everyone is welcome to contribute as needed. And for the love of pete ... if you read my last books, I know I need help with typos!

### What else?

This book will not only talk about Sass as a language, but using Sass as a core utility for building today's modern web apps. These topics will include such things as file structures, component architectures, style guides and design systems and how newer tools like PostCSS play into all of this as well.
